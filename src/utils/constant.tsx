    "The electricity sector has already done much of the heavy lifting, abating around one-third of its projected emissions over the past decade through the rollout of renewable energy projects. This transformation is proof that clean energy is not only cutting pollution but also driving a jobs and investment boom across regional Australia.",
    "Australia's clean energy industry is absolutely committed to achieving the nation's renewable energy goals by 2035. The transformation already underway shows what's possible: in just eight years, Australia has more than doubled the amount of renewable energy in the system, from 17 per cent renewables in 2017 to just over 40 per cent in 2025. With critical mass now within reach, every new project makes the next one faster and easier, unlocking momentum that will accelerate Australia's clean energy build-out.",
    "The world is building renewables at an extraordinary pace. In April of this year, China added as much solar as Australia has in its entire history and, with global supply chains now delivering wind and solar at scale, the technology is cheaper and more accessible than ever.",
    "The clean energy industry is fully committed to doing its part to meet this new target. Renewable energy, backed by firming and storage, is delivering clean, reliable and affordable power for Australian families and businesses. At the same time, the sector is creating tens of thousands of jobs, strengthening regional economies, and attracting tens of billions of dollars in private capital.",
    "Today's decision sets the direction for the next chapter of Australia's energy transformation. With clear targets and the right policy settings, we can accelerate the shift to a modern energy system, continue to cut emissions, and ensure Australian workers, businesses and communities share in the benefits of the transition.",

        question: "How long does development take?",
        answer:
          "A starter site typically takes 3 to 4 weeks. A business site runs 8 to 10 weeks, and enterprise projects are scoped individually. The single biggest variable is how quickly final content and approvals come back, so we build the content deadline into the plan from day one.",

        question: "Do you provide hosting?",
        answer:
          "Yes. We host on Vercel, AWS, or Cloudflare depending on the build, and we can also deploy into infrastructure you already own. Managed hosting includes SSL, daily backups, uptime monitoring, and patching. If you would rather self-host, we hand over the deployment pipeline and documentation at no extra cost.",

        question: "Can you redesign my current website?",
        answer:
          "That is a large share of our work. We start with a technical and content audit, map every existing URL so search rankings carry across, and rebuild in stages. In most cases we can keep your current site live until the replacement is fully tested.",

        id: "f4",
        question: "Will my website be SEO optimized?",
        answer:
          "Every build ships with semantic HTML, a proper heading hierarchy, structured data, generated sitemaps, canonical URLs, and Open Graph tags. You receive a technical SEO audit at handover. We do not sell ongoing content marketing, but we will happily work alongside the agency that does.",
      },
      {
        id: "f5",
        question: "Can I edit the website myself?",
        answer:
          "Yes. We integrate a CMS with structured, guard-railed fields rather than a blank rich-text box, so edits stay on-brand and cannot break the layout. Editor training and a short written guide are included in every project above the starter tier.",

        id: "f6",
        question: "Do you provide maintenance?",

      {
        id: "f7",
        question: "What technologies do you use?",
        answer:
          "Mostly React, Next.js, and TypeScript on the frontend, with Node.js, Laravel, or WordPress behind it depending on your team's skills. For ecommerce we use Shopify or WooCommerce. We choose the well-supported option your team can maintain, not whatever is trending.",

        id: "f8",
        question: "How much does a website cost?",
        answer:
          "Starter sites begin around $2,400, business sites around $6,900, and enterprise work is quoted after discovery. Price is driven by page count, integrations, and content volume. You get a fixed-scope quote before any work starts, so the number does not move mid-project.",
